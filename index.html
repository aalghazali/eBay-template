<p>This 2015 Chevrolet Silverado LT will come with a rebuilt-reconstructed Michigan title. This vehicle was in a previous accident which affected the left front door, left rear door, and both quarter panels. We replaced the left front door with matching colors. The left rear door had minor dents which was repaired and painted back to specs. The quarter panels also had minor dents which were also repaired. All the work was done flawlessly with no previous signs of an accident!</p>


<p>
This 2015 Chevrolet Silverado LT has undergone a Michigan state police inspection in order to determine if it is road worthy. It has since passed inspection and has been issued a Michigan rebuilt title.
</p>

<p>
A rebuilt title is the same as a clear/clean title except for the fact that the vehicle was in a previous accident. The vehicle had to undergone a Michigan state police inspection to determine whether or not the vehicle is road worthy. A vehicle only passes a state of Michigan inspection test if all tests come back as safe and road worthy. A rebuilt title can be registered in all states with ease. Please check your local DMV for further information.
